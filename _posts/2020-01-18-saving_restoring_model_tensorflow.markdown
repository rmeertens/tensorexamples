A full tutorial can be found here: https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/checkpoint

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class Net(tf.keras.Model):
  """A simple linear model."""

  def __init__(self):
    super(Net, self).__init__()
    self.l1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(5)

  def call(self, x):
    return self.l1(x)

net = Net()
net.save_weights('easy_checkpoint')
```

Next up you can load the weights again, but this requires the network to already be loaded, with the same amount of layers. 

```python
net.load_weights('easy_checkpoint')
```







```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_images(dataset, n_images, samples_per_image):
    output = np.zeros((32 * n_images, 32 * samples_per_image, 3))

    row = 0
    for images in dataset.repeat(samples_per_image).batch(n_images):
        output[:, row*32:(row+1)*32] = np.vstack(images.numpy())
        row += 1

    plt.figure()
    plt.imshow(output)
    plt.show()
```


You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
